ðŸš€ Campus Recruitment Prediction Project ðŸŽ“ðŸ’¼

Excited to share my latest projectâ€”Campus Recruitment Prediction, where I built a machine learning model to predict students' placement status and expected salary based on academic and professional factors. This project aims to assist students and recruiters in making data-driven hiring decisions.

This project was an exciting opportunity to combine data science and web development, reinforcing my skills in machine learning, model deployment, and data-driven decision-making. ðŸš€
